## What is Magento?
Magento is an ecommerce platform that enables companies to run and manage their ecommerce sites in an optimized way. Magento functions as an open source ecommerce management system. It was first published by a Varien Inc in 2008, before being sold to eBay and ultimately spun off into its own entity. The 2.0 version of Magento arrived in November of 2015 and has improved the platform across the board.
