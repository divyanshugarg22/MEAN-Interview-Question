### 1. What is OOPS?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data.

### 2. basic Concepts of OOPs?
Abstraction.
Encapsulation. 
Inheritance. 
Polymorphism.

### 3. What is a class?
A set or category of things having some property or attribute in common and differentiated from others by kind, type, or quality.

### 4. What is an object?
Objects are created from Classes, in C#, is an instance of a class that is created dynamically. Object is also a keyword that is an alias for the predefined type System.

### 5. What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into a single component. The features of encapsulation are supported using classes in most object-oriented programming languages, although other alternatives also exist.

It allows selective hiding of properties and methods in an object by building an impenetrable wall to protect the code from accidental corruption.

### 6. What is Polymorphism?
In programming languages and type theory, polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types.
A polymorphic type is a type whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type, or types.

### 7. What is Inheritance?
inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object or class, using the same implementation (inheriting from a class) specifying implementation to maintain the same behavior (realizing an interface; inheriting behavior).

It is a mechanism for code reuse and to allow independent extensions of the original software via public classes and interfaces.

### 8. What is Constructor?
A is special method of the class that will be automatically invoked when an instance of the class is created is called as constructor.

Constructors are mainly used to initialize private fields of the class while creating an instance for the class.

When you are not creating a constructor in the class, then compiler will automatically create a default constructor in the class that initializes all numeric fields in the class to zero and all string and object fields to null.

### 9. Types of Constructors
  Basically constructors are 5 types those are
  Default Constructor
  Parameterized Constructor
  Copy Constructor
  Static Constructor
  Private Constructor
